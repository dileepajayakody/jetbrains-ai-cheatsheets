# Remote mode

Last modified: 28 August 2026

Slash command to switch to Remote mode:

`/remote`

Remote mode lets you open your running Junie CLI session in a web browser and keep working on the same task from another device. The Junie CLI process keeps running in your terminal — Remote mode adds a synchronized web UI on top of it.

## How Remote mode works

When you start Remote mode, Junie CLI opens a secure tunnel to the Junie web app and streams the session into a web UI:

-   The CLI session continues to run in your terminal, on your machine.

-   The web UI shows the same chat history, progress, interactive prompts, and task status.

-   Anything you send from the web UI — prompts, replies to approval requests, plan refinements — is routed back to the same running session.

Both the terminal and the web UI work against a single shared session, so you can switch between them at any time without losing context.

> ### note
>
> Your machine must stay awake while a remote session is active. If the computer goes to sleep, the CLI process is suspended and the web UI cannot communicate with it until you wake the machine.

## Requirements

Remote mode requires a Junie subscription:

-   Sign in with your JetBrains Account, or

-   Use a `JUNIE_API_KEY` access token.

[Bring Your Own Key (BYOK)](byok.html) on its own is not enough — Remote mode itself goes through the Junie service and requires one of the two options above.

> ### warning
>
> Remote mode is not available when Junie CLI is signed in through JetBrains AI Enterprise. To use Remote Mode, sign in with your JetBrains Account or a `JUNIE_API_KEY` instead. See [Manage your account](junie-cli.html#manage-your-account).

## Start a remote session

1.  In Junie CLI, in a new or running session, run the `/remote` command.

    ```
    > /remote
    ```

2.  On the Remote mode screen, select Start Remote Session.

    Junie CLI creates the tunnel and prints a confirmation message with the connection URL.

3.  Open [`junie.jetbrains.com/remote`](https://junie.jetbrains.com/remote) in your browser.

    The web app connects to your running CLI session and replays the chat history. After that, the terminal and the browser stay in sync.

> ### tip
>
> Run `/remote` again to see the status of the active remote session, including connection state and the option to stop it.

## What you can do from the web UI

The web UI exposes the most common actions for continuing a task:

-   Send a new prompt to the agent.

-   Reply to interactive requests (approve or decline an action, answer a question, pick an option).

-   Cancel the current task.

-   Continue the task after the step limit is reached.

-   Toggle [brave mode](junie-cli.html#brave-mode).

-   Refine a proposed plan in [plan mode](junie-cli-plan-mode.html), or confirm a plan and ask the agent to implement it.

## Limitations

The web UI is intentionally narrower than the terminal. It is built to keep working on an existing CLI session, not to fully replace the terminal:

-   Slash commands such as `/new`, `/history`, `/account`, `/model`, `/usage`, `/ide`, `/mcp`, `/quit`, and custom slash commands are available only in the terminal.

-   Shell commands invoked with `!` in the prompt are terminal-only.

-   File and folder picking with `@` is not available in the web UI.

-   Drag-and-drop of files and images is not available in the web UI.

-   Prompt history search (`Ctrl+R`) and the session transcript view (`Ctrl+O`) are terminal-only.

-   Only one web client can be connected to a remote session at a time. Opening the URL from another tab or device takes over the connection from the previous client.

If you need any of these features, switch back to the terminal — the session is the same, and your changes from the web UI are already there.

## Stop a remote session

To stop sharing the current session with the web app:

1.  Run `/remote` in the terminal.

2.  On the status screen, select Stop Remote Session.

Stopping a remote session does not affect the underlying CLI session — you can continue working in the terminal or start a new remote session later.
