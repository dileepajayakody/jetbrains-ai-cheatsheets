# Add and configure extensions

Last modified: 28 August 2026

Extensions are reusable bundles that extend Junie CLI with project-specific or domain-specific capabilities. A single extension can package any combination of:

-   [Agent skills](agent-skills.html)

-   [MCP servers](junie-cli-mcp-configuration.html)

-   [Subagents](junie-cli-subagents.html)

-   [Custom slash commands](custom-slash-commands.html)

-   [Guidelines](guidelines-and-memory.html)

-   [Hooks](junie-cli-hooks.html)

This makes extensions a convenient way to install a curated set of capabilities for a particular technology stack (for example, an Android, Spring Boot, or SQL extension), share team-wide setups, or distribute community-built integrations — without manually configuring each piece.

Run the `/extensions` slash command (aliases: `/plugin`, `/plugins`) to open the extensions screen, where you can browse marketplaces, install, update and remove extensions, and configure additional marketplaces.

## Marketplaces

Extensions are distributed via marketplaces. A marketplace exposes a manifest with a list of available extensions and references to where their content is hosted. Junie CLI supports three ways to host a marketplace:

-   A git repository (GitHub, GitLab, self-hosted, any host).

-   A local directory on your machine.

-   A direct HTTP(S) URL pointing at a `marketplace.json` file.

Two manifest formats are supported in all three cases:

-   The native Junie format at `.junie-extension/marketplace.json`.

-   The [Claude plugin](https://docs.claude.com/) format at `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`.

This means you can connect any Claude-compatible plugin marketplace to Junie CLI in addition to Junie's native marketplaces.

### Built-in marketplace

Junie CLI ships with the official JetBrains marketplace pre-registered:

[https://github.com/JetBrains/junie-extensions](https://github.com/JetBrains/junie-extensions)

The marketplace contains a curated set of extensions maintained by the Junie team — for example, extensions for Java, Kotlin, Android, Spring Boot, SQL, Redis, and others.

### Add a custom marketplace

To register an additional marketplace:

1.  Run `/extensions` and switch to the Marketplaces tab.

2.  Choose Add marketplace and provide one of the supported spec formats:

    Spec

    Recognized as

    `https://github.com/owner/repo`

    GitHub repository (clones locally)

    `owner/repo`

    GitHub shorthand, expanded to `https://github.com/owner/repo`

    `git@github.com:owner/repo`

    Git over SSH

    `https://gitlab.com/owner/repo` (or any other host)

    Generic git repository

    `./relative/path`, `/abs/path`, `~/path`, `file:///…`

    Local directory

    `https://example.com/marketplace.json`

    Direct URL to a `marketplace.json` (HTTP-only, no clone). GitHub `/blob/` URLs are auto-rewritten to the raw form.

    The source must contain either a `.junie-extension/marketplace.json` or a `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` file at its root (for git / local sources). URL sources point directly at the manifest file.

3.  Depending on the type, Junie CLI clones the repo, probes the local directory, or fetches the JSON, then lists its extensions in the catalog.

To remove a custom marketplace, select it in the Marketplaces tab and choose Remove. The built-in JetBrains marketplace cannot be removed.

You can also drive the same actions inline via `/extensions <arg>`:

```
/extensions marketplace add <spec>
/extensions marketplace remove
```

## Install an extension

1.  Run `/extensions` to open the extensions screen.

2.  Browse the catalog of available extensions across all registered marketplaces, or use search to find a specific extension.

3.  Select an extension and choose the installation scope:

    -   Project scope: the extension is enabled only in the current project. The reference is stored in `.junie/extensions.json` at the root of the project. This file can be checked into version control and shared with the team.

    -   User scope: the extension is enabled across all projects on your machine. The reference is stored in `~/.junie/extensions/extensions.json` (or `%USERPROFILE%\.junie\extensions\extensions.json` on Windows).

Extension content (skills, agents, commands, MCP configs, guidelines, hooks) is downloaded once into the user-level cache directory `~/.junie/extensions/<marketplace>/<extension>/` and reused across projects.

You can also pass a raw trailing argument directly to the `/extensions` command, for example:

```
/extensions install <extension-name>
```

Newly installed extensions become available within the running session — there is no need to restart Junie CLI.

## Remove an extension

To uninstall an extension:

1.  Run `/extensions` and switch to the Installed tab.

2.  Select the extension and choose Remove.

The reference is removed from the corresponding `extensions.json` file. Cached content under `~/.junie/extensions/` may be reused if the extension is reinstalled later.

## Update an extension

To pull the latest version of an installed extension, select it in the Installed tab and choose Update.

## Where extensions are stored

Location

Purpose

`~/.junie/extensions/`

Base directory for cached extension content.

`~/.junie/extensions/extensions.json`

User-scope configuration: extensions enabled for the current user across all projects.

`~/.junie/extensions/marketplaces.json`

Registry for registered marketplace repositories and their sync status.

`.junie/extensions.json`

Project-scope configuration: extensions enabled for the current project; can be committed to VCS.

`~/.junie/extensions/marketplaces/`

Per-marketplace caches: git clones, local-dir caches, fetched `marketplace.json` files.

Both `extensions.json` files share the same format: a flat JSON object that maps a marketplace identifier to the list of installed extensions for that marketplace. A typed `source` is stored alongside so a teammate who pulls the project can auto-register the marketplace without configuring it manually:

```
{
  "github-JetBrains-junie-extensions": { "extensions": ["context7"] },
  "github-myorg-myrepo": {
    "url": "https://github.com/myorg/myrepo",
    "source": { "type": "git", "url": "https://github.com/myorg/myrepo" },
    "extensions": ["my-ext"]
  },
  "local-my-dir-abc12345": {
    "source": { "type": "local", "path": "/Users/me/my-marketplace" },
    "extensions": ["my-local-ext"]
  },
  "url-github-anthropics-knowledge-work-plugins-xxxxxxxxxx": {
    "source": { "type": "url", "url": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anthropics/knowledge-work-plugins/main/.claude-plugin/marketplace.json" },
    "extensions": ["some-ext"]
  }
}
```

The legacy `url` field is kept populated for git sources so older Junie versions can still downgrade-read the config.

You can override the base directory with the following command-line option:

Option

Default

Description

`--extensions-default-location <path>`

`~/.junie/extensions`

Override the default extensions directory. Can also be set via the `JUNIE_EXTENSIONS_DEFAULT_LOCATION` environment variable.
