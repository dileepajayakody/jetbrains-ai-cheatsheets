# Quickstart

Last modified: 28 August 2026

Junie CLI is the agentic coding tool by JetBrains that provides an interactive terminal interface for developers to review, write, and modify code.

### Supported operating systems

Junie CLI is available on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

### Step 1: Install Junie CLI

In the terminal or command prompt of your choice, run:

Linux / macOS

Windows

npm

Homebrew

```
curl -fsSL https://junie.jetbrains.com/install.sh | bash
```

```
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "iex (irm 'https://junie.jetbrains.com/install.ps1')"
```

```
npm install -g @jetbrains/junie
```

```
brew install jetbrains/junie/junie
```

### Step 2: Start Junie in your project

Navigate to the root directory of the project where you want to use Junie CLI and run `junie`:

```
cd /path/to/your/project
```

```
junie
```

### Step 3: Authenticate

On the Junie welcome screen, select one of the available authentication options:

-   Continue with JetBrains account

    Use Junie CLI as part of your subscription plan with JetBrains. When selecting this option, you'll be redirected to the JetBrains Junie login page in your browser.

-   Use a Junie API key

    Run Junie CLI with usage-based billing. When selecting this option, you'll be prompted to provide an access token. To generate your `JUNIE_API_KEY` access token, go to [junie.jetbrains.com/cli](https://junie.jetbrains.com/cli).

-   Use your own API key (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, xAI, OpenRouter, GitHub Copilot)

    Use your own API keys from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, xAI, OpenRouter, GitHub Copilot, or other third-party LLM providers. Junie CLI uses these API keys to send requests to LLMs directly without requiring a JetBrains AI subscription. For details, see [Bring Your Own Key (BYOK)](byok.html).

    BYOK can be used on its own or together with JetBrains Account authorization or Junie API key. If a model is available through both the BYOK API key and JetBrains AI subscription, the requests are billed to your BYOK provider directly.

-   [Use custom models and endpoints](custom-llm-models.html)

    Connect Junie CLI to custom or self-hosted LLM endpoints, such as LiteLLM, Ollama, or LM Studio.

> ### note
>
> Depending on your JetBrains subscription and setup, the welcome screen may offer additional options, such as signing in with JetBrains Enterprise or using local models.

### Step 4: Type your prompt

Type the prompt in the interactive CLI, for example:

```
> give me an overview of this codebase
```

Use `@` to attach a file or folder from the current project to the request context. To see the list of available slash commands and use them, type `/`.

### Real-time follow-ups

You can type follow-up prompts while Junie CLI is working on the task without waiting for it to finish. The added clarifications are appended to the initial prompt and taken into account by the agent immediately.

### Reference files and directories

Use `@` to quickly reference files or directories in your prompt.

![Reference files and folders](img/junie/reference_files_and_folders.png "Reference files and folders")

You can also drag and drop files and images into the terminal window to reference them.

### Image inputs

Drag and drop or reference screenshots or design specs in the prompt for Junie CLI to read the image details. Junie CLI accepts all common image formats such as PNG and JPEG.

### Search the prompt history

Junie CLI preserves your prompt history across all sessions and application runs.

To search the prompt history, use `Ctrl+R`, and then navigate through the results using Up and Down arrow keys.

## Slash commands and shortcuts

Slash commands allow you to access various Junie CLI features directly from the prompt. Type `/` in the prompt to see and use the [available slash commands](slash-commands.html).

Some built-in slash commands accept user prompts as arguments. For example, `/new fix tests` [starts another live session](/docs/junie-cli.html#clear-up-session-context) with `fix tests` in the prompt, and `/plan refactor commands` enables [plan mode](/docs/junie-cli.html#plan-mode) and submits `refactor commands` immediately.

In addition to the built-in commands, you can [add custom slash commands](custom-slash-commands.html) for frequently used prompts and repetitive tasks.

To see all available shortcuts, type `?`.

## Run shell commands

You can run shell commands without leaving Junie CLI by prefixing it with `!`, for example:

```
!ls -la
```

## Command approval

For running potentially sensitive actions, such as executing most of the terminal commands, editing files outside the project, or invoking MCP tools, Junie CLI will ask for approval from the user.

### Action Allowlist

When Junie CLI stops for user approval, you can select the → Always allow option to add the indicated command to the Action Allowlist. Once on the Action Allowlist, the command will always be executed without user approval in the future Junie CLI runs.

![Action allowlist junie cli](img/junie/action_allowlist_junie_cli.png "Action allowlist junie cli")

The full list of allowed commands and command patterns is stored in the `~/.junie/allowlist.json` file. You can also edit this file manually to add or remove allowed or restricted commands and patterns. For details, see [Action Allowlist configuration](action-allowlist-junie-cli.html).

### Brave mode

Brave mode controls how much Junie CLI relies on user approval before running potentially sensitive actions. It has three levels that you can cycle through with the `/brave` slash command or the `Ctrl+B` shortcut:

-   Off – Junie CLI asks for approval for every potentially sensitive action that is not on the Action Allowlist. This is the most conservative behavior.

-   Auto – Junie CLI classifies terminal commands with a safety check and automatically approves the ones it considers safe, while still asking for approval for risky or unrecognized commands and for other sensitive actions.

-   On – Junie CLI executes all potentially sensitive actions without user approval.

![Brave mode on](img/junie/brave_mode_on.png "Brave mode on")

## Plan mode

In plan mode, Junie CLI analyzes the codebase with read-only operations and produces a design document for the task before any code is written. Toggle plan mode with the `Shift+Tab` shortcut or the `/plan` slash command.

You can also start Junie CLI directly in plan mode using the `--plan` flag:

```
junie --plan
junie --prompt "Refactor the commands module" --plan
```

For details, see [Plan mode](junie-cli-plan-mode.html).

## Debug mode

In debug mode, Junie CLI acts as an AI debugging assistant that manages breakpoints, inspects runtime state, and evaluates expressions against a live debugger session in a connected JetBrains IDE. Toggle debug mode with the `Shift+Tab+Tab` shortcut or the `/debug` slash command. For details, see [Debug Mode](junie-cli-debug-mode.html).

## Local code review

Use the `/review` slash command to run a code review of your local changes before you commit them. Junie CLI uses the same review backend as [automated code reviews](automated-code-reviews.html) on GitHub, so the feedback you get locally is consistent with what would be reported on a pull request.

When you run `/review`, Junie CLI detects the git state of the project and offers a wizard with only the review targets that make sense in the current state:

-   From Main: review your current branch against `main`. Shown only when a `main` branch exists and you are not currently on it (there is nothing to compare if you are already on `main`).

-   Last Commit: review the diff of the most recent commit. Always available as long as the project has at least one commit.

-   Unstaged Changes: review changes that are not yet staged. Shown only when there are actual unstaged changes in the working tree.

Pick an option, and Junie CLI will start a review task that comments on the selected diff.

![Review wizard](img/junie/review_wizard.png "Review wizard")

After the review is complete, Junie CLI presents the findings and lets you accept or dismiss individual comments.

![Review results](img/junie/review_results.png "Review results")

> ### note
>
> `/review` requires the current project to be a Git repository. If no `.git` directory is found, Junie CLI reports that no git repository was detected and does not start the wizard.

## Manage your account

Use the `/account` command to manage your credentials and API keys:

-   Select Continue with JetBrains account (or Manage JetBrains account if you're already signed in) to authenticate with Junie CLI via your JetBrains Account.

-   Select Use a Junie API key to run Junie CLI with usage-based billing.

    To generate a `JUNIE_API_KEY` access token, go to [junie.jetbrains.com/cli](https://junie.jetbrains.com/cli).

-   Select Use your own API key (or Manage your API keys) to add API keys for LLM providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, xAI, or OpenRouter. See [Bring Your Own Key (BYOK)](byok.html).

    > ### tip
    >
    > BYOK can be used on its own or together with JetBrains Account authorization. If a model is available through both the BYOK API key and JetBrains AI subscription, the requests are billed directly to the model provider without consuming credits from your JetBrains account.

-   Select Use custom models and endpoints to connect custom or self-hosted LLM endpoints such as LiteLLM, Ollama, or LM Studio. See [Custom LLM models](custom-llm-models.html).

## Manage your session

### Start another session

Use `/new` to start another live session in the same interactive Junie instance. Existing live sessions keep running in the background and stay available in Task history.

Use `/new <prompt>` to start another session with the prompt text already filled in.

### View session transcript

To access the full transcript of the current session, including all previous prompts and the agent output, use the `Ctrl+O` shortcut. By default, Junie opens a continuously updated `transcript.md` file stored next to the session's `events.jsonl` file. Subagent transcripts are stored in the session's `subagents` folder and `Ctrl+O` opens the selected subagent transcript while you are viewing its task.

Use `/settings` and change Show transcript to Terminal to open the built-in Transcript view instead. In that view, use `Esc` to return to the main view.

### Switch sessions and resume history

To search session history, switch between live sessions, or resume a saved session from a previous run, use `/history` to open Task history.

Junie stores the full session context, including LLM usage data and the history of user prompts and agent responses, for all your saved sessions.

For details on running several sessions and isolating their file changes, see [Parallel sessions and worktrees](junie-cli-worktrees.html).

### Quit the session

To exit the Junie CLI interactive mode without losing login credentials, use `/quit`. Alternatively, you can exit Junie CLI by using `Ctrl+C` twice.

### Continue the session in a browser

Use `/remote` to share the running Junie CLI session with the Junie web app and continue working on the same task from another device. For details, see [Remote Mode](junie-cli-remote-mode.html).

## Model and effort

Use `/model` to select the LLM and, for supported models, the reasoning effort level used for the current session. `Default` is the recommended pre-selected option that uses a dynamically set model with the best price-quality ratio.

The selection of available models depends on your [authentication method](/docs/junie-cli.html#step-3-authenticate) with Junie CLI. With BYOK, only the provider-specific models are available.

![Model selection with effort](img/junie/model_selection_with_effort.png "Model selection with effort")

### Effort level

For models that support adjustable reasoning effort (for example, recent Claude, GPT-5, and Gemini models), you can pick how hard the model thinks before answering. The set of supported effort levels (such as `None`, `Minimal`, `Low`, `Medium`, `High`, `XHigh`, `Max`) depends on the selected model.

You can change the effort level in two ways:

-   Use the `/model` command and pick an effort level alongside the model.

-   Use the dedicated `/effort` command to change only the effort level for the current model.

![Effort level selection](img/junie/effort_level_selection.png "Effort level selection")

You can also set the default effort level for new sessions with the `--effort <level>` CLI flag or the `JUNIE_EFFORT` environment variable. For details, see [Model selection](junie-cli-model-selection.html).

> ### note
>
> We recommend keeping the default model and effort settings. Higher effort levels do not always produce noticeably better results, but they can cost significantly more and make the model take noticeably longer to respond as it spends more time reasoning. Increase the effort only when you have observed that a specific task benefits from it.

## Token usage and costs

The `/usage` command shows the cost breakdown for the current session, including token usage, used models, and remaining balance.

## Non-interactive (headless) mode

You can run Junie CLI in headless mode, that is, programmatically without interactive UI, in CI/CD environments and build pipelines.

To add Junie to your CI/CD script:

```
# Install Junie CLI
curl -fsSL https://junie.jetbrains.com/install.sh | bash

# Authenticate and run a task
junie --auth="$JUNIE_API_KEY" "Fix any failing tests"

# Run a code review of the latest commit
junie --auth="$JUNIE_API_KEY" --review
```

The `junie` command takes [options](parameters.html) and [environment variables](environment-variables.html).

For more information and examples, see [Headless mode](junie-headless.html).
