# Add and configure MCP servers

Last modified: 26 June 2026

You can connect Junie CLI to external tools via Model Context Protocol (MCP). Junie CLI uses the same MCP JSON configuration as [Junie in JetBrains IDEs](junie-ide-plugin.html#mcp-configuration).

The `/mcp` slash command shows the [list of configured MCP servers](/docs/junie-cli-mcp-configuration.html#list-configured-mcp-servers) and the [MCP Installation Assistant](/docs/junie-cli-mcp-configuration.html#mcp-installation-assistant) to guide you through adding, editing, or troubleshooting configs for MCP servers.

## MCP Installation Assistant

Junie's MCP Installation Assistant is an AI helper that streamlines and simplifies the process of adding new MCP servers. It guides you through adding MCP servers from a registry of pre-configured servers or from scratch.

When adding a server from the registry, Junie CLI automatically configures the correct command or URL and prompts the user for any required secrets or environment variables.

When adding a server from scratch, it searches the [official MCP registry](https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io/) for the proper server configuration, prompts for parameters, env variables, secrets, or API tokens if needed, adds the server configuration to the `mcp.json` file, and verifies the server startup.

### Add an MCP server

1.  Use the `/mcp` command to open the MCP server configuration screen.

2.  Press `Ctrl+A` to open and search the list of pre-configured MCP servers.

    If the MCP server you need is not on the list, press `Ctrl+A` once again and follow Installation Assistant's prompts to set up the server configuration from scratch.

3.  Select the server installation scope:

    -   Project scope: MCP server configs are stored in the `.junie/mcp/mcp.json` file at the root of your project. This file can be checked into version control and shared across all team members.

        > ### tip
        >
        > Warning
        >
        > For project-scope installations, avoid sharing secrets or sensitive environment variables if the `.junie/mcp/mcp.json` file is committed to version control.

    -   User scope: user-scope MCP configs are stored in `~/.junie/mcp/mcp.json` and available across all projects on your machine while remaining private to your user account.

4.  Select the server connection type:

    -   Remote: connect to a hosted server via HTTP/HTTPS.

        Junie CLI connects to an MCP server hosted on a remote machine or service.

    -   Local: run on your machine (Docker, npx, or binary).

        Junie CLI starts an MCP server instance locally, e.g. using the `npx` command or via Docker.

### OAuth authorization

Remote MCP servers that require OAuth authorization are added to the list of configured servers with an Authorization required status. Use MCP Installation Assistant to set up OAuth authorization:

1.  Select the server on the list to open its configuration menu.

2.  Select → Authorize and then follow the steps to login in the respective server's browser page that opens.

3.  Verify that the server's status has changed to Active.

## Add an MCP server from JSON configuration

If you have a JSON configuration for an MCP server, you can add it manually directly to the `.junie/mcp/mcp.json` file at the project or user scope.

The `mcp.json` file uses the following JSON structure:

```
mcp.json
```

Manually added configurations are imported to the list of MCP servers and enabled by default. To verify that the server is available to Junie CLI and active, use the `/mcp` command.

## List configured MCP servers

To list all configured MCP servers, as well as disable/enable, modify, or delete existing configurations, use the `/mcp` command. The list shows:

-   MCP server name.

-   Installation scope (project or user).

-   Server status (Starting/Active/Inactive/Disabled/Failed/Authorization required).

> ### tip
>
> MCP server statuses
>
> Servers that are neither Active nor Disabled can be either Inactive or Failed.
>
> The Inactive status indicates that the server is correctly configured and enabled but is not currently running.
>
> The Failed status indicates that an error occurred while attempting to connect to the server, the server cannot be started or crashes while running. This could be due to invalid configuration, authentication failure, missing dependencies, or server's runtime crash.

Configuration for MCP servers is stored in the `mcp.json` file at the following default locations:

-   Project scope: `.junie/mcp/mcp.json` at the root of your project.

-   User scope: `~/.junie/mcp/mcp.json` on your machine.

You can control where Junie searches for MCP configurations using the following command-line options:

Option

Default

Description

`--mcp-default-locations`

`true`

Enable or disable adding MCP servers from default locations (per user / per project).

`--mcp-location <path>`

—

Additional folders where MCP servers should be found. Can be specified multiple times.

## Enable or disable an MCP server

The MCP servers connected via MCP Installation Assistant or imported from the `mcp.json` file are enabled by default.

To disable a server, list all the configured servers with the `/mcp` command, select the necessary server, and then select the → Disable action. To enable a previously disabled server, use → Enable.
