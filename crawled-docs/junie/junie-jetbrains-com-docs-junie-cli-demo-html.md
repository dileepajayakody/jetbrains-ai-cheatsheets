The `/demo` slash command launches a visual demo of your project. Junie CLI spins up a disposable virtual machine, builds and starts your app inside it, and then drives the running UI — clicking, typing, and taking screenshots — to show that a feature or recent change works. The result is a structured Markdown answer in the TUI plus a folder of [output artifacts](/docs/junie-cli-demo.html#output-artifacts) — screenshots, a screen recording, and a self-contained HTML report — that you can share or attach to a PR.

Think of it as 'show me, don't tell me': instead of asking Junie to read code and explain a change, you ask Junie to use the app and prove the change is real on screen.

## Prerequisites

`/demo` requires:

-   Docker running on your machine. This is the most important prerequisite — the demo VM is a Docker container, and `/demo` will not start without a working Docker daemon. If `docker ps` doesn't work in your terminal, `/demo` won't work either. Start Docker Desktop before running `/demo`. Junie checks this before a run starts and tells you right away rather than failing halfway through, on every path that can launch a demo.

-   A model with Computer Use support. Right now only GPT‑5.4, GPT‑5.5, and GPT‑5.6 SOL are supported. More models will be added later as Computer Use becomes available on them. If your active model doesn't qualify, `/demo` refuses to start and shows the supported list. See [Junie CLI Model selection](junie-cli-model-selection.html).

-   A demo VM image at `.junie/vms/<name>/Dockerfile`, layered on top of the base image `registry.jetbrains.team/p/junie-cli/containers/demo-base:2`. The base is Debian bookworm and ships Chromium, Node.js, xterm, ffmpeg, xdotool, screenshot tooling and a headless Xvfb desktop with a window manager — everything Computer Use needs to drive a desktop or web app. When `/demo` runs in a project that has no VM template, Junie seeds a starter one for you — see [First-run setup](/docs/junie-cli-demo.html#first-run-setup). Add the runtimes your app needs on top, as shown in [Customizing the demo](/docs/junie-cli-demo.html#customizing-the-demo).

## Quick start

You have two ways to set up `/demo` for a project: author the files by hand as shown below, or skip authoring and let `/demo` create starter versions for you (see [First-run setup](/docs/junie-cli-demo.html#first-run-setup)).

For projects that need anything beyond "open a browser at localhost", you'll typically set up three things in your repo:

1.  A custom image on top of `demo-base`. Create `.junie/vms/<your-vm>/Dockerfile` that starts with `FROM registry.jetbrains.team/p/junie-cli/containers/demo-base:2` and adds the runtimes your app needs (JDK, Node, Python, system packages…). The base already handles the display stack — don't reinstall it.

    Node example:

    ```
    # .junie/vms/node-vm/Dockerfile
    FROM registry.jetbrains.team/p/junie-cli/containers/demo-base:2
    RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends nodejs npm
    ```

    Python example:

    ```
    # .junie/vms/python-vm/Dockerfile
    FROM registry.jetbrains.team/p/junie-cli/containers/demo-base:2
    RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends python3 python3-pip
    ```

2.  Mounts (optional). The project root is always mounted at `/workspace` automatically — you don't need to configure that. For extra bind mounts (host credentials, fixture data, prebuilt artifacts on the host), create a text file at `.junie/vms/<your-vm>/mounts` (no extension, not a directory) with one mount per line:

    ```
    # <hostPath>:<guestPath>[:ro|:rw]
    # $HOME and ${HOME} are expanded from the environment.
    # Lines starting with # are ignored.
    $HOME/.config/my-app:/root/.config/my-app:ro
    /tmp/my-fixtures:/workspace/fixtures
    ```

    Missing host paths are skipped with a warning — Junie won't refuse to start the VM because of a stale mount line.

3.  A `.junie/demo.md` file telling the agent which VM to use and how to build/launch the app. The `vm:` value must match the subdirectory name you created in step 1 — that's how Junie binds the file to your Dockerfile.

    Node project — `vm: node-vm` matches `.junie/vms/node-vm/`:

    ```
    # My web app

    vm: node-vm

    ## Build inside the VM
        npm install && npm run build

    ## Launch
        npm run start &
        # ready when http://localhost:3000 responds 200
    ```

    Python project — `vm: python-vm` matches `.junie/vms/python-vm/`:

    ```
    # My Python app

    vm: python-vm

    ## Build inside the VM
        pip install -r requirements.txt

    ## Launch
        python app.py &
        # ready when http://localhost:5000 responds 200
    ```

    Shortcut: if you only ever need one VM, you can skip the subdirectory and put the Dockerfile straight at `.junie/vms/Dockerfile`. Then reference it in `.junie/demo.md` as `vm: default`.

Now `/demo` will pick up your custom image, mounts, and launch instructions automatically.

## Basic usage

The command never starts a demo straight away — it always opens the picker:

```
/demo
```

### Choosing what to demo

Junie asks what you would like it to demo and offers a short list of scopes to choose from, with a text field right below it for [describing the demo yourself](/docs/junie-cli-demo.html#describing-the-demo-yourself) (navigate with the arrow keys, Enter to pick, Esc to cancel):

-   Changes of this branch (vs `origin/main`) — everything the current branch adds on top of the default branch, including changes you haven't committed yet. The ref in the label is the default branch Junie resolved for your repository (`origin/main`, `origin/master`, `main`, or `master`).

-   Changes from this session — the messages you exchanged, the files Junie touched, the task it just finished. You don't have to repeat what was done; the demo agent already sees it.

-   Uncommitted changes — your working tree compared to `HEAD`. Files that aren't tracked by git yet are picked up too.

-   Last commit — the last commit compared to its parent.

-   Smoke test — find anything broken — Junie drives the app's main flows looking for breakage and reports what works and what doesn't.

The list adapts to your project: the branch scope only shows up when you're not on the default branch, Uncommitted changes only when the working tree is dirty, Last commit only when there is a commit to compare against. Outside a git repository (or when git isn't installed) you get the session scope and the smoke test.

For the three git scopes the diff is the specification of the demo: Junie reads it first, lists every user-visible change in it, and demonstrates them one by one instead of stopping at the first one. This is the most common way to use `/demo`: you've just had Junie implement or fix something, and you want to see it working before you commit — type `/demo`, hit Enter, and pick the scope that matches what you want to see.

### Describing the demo yourself

None of the scopes has to fit: the picker always has a free‑form field below the list. Press ↓ past the last scope to get into it (or type the request right after `/demo` to land in it directly), and type what you want to see in plain natural language:

```
show the new dark-theme toggle in Settings
open the search dialog and find 'TODO'
log in as user@example.com and open the profile page
```

Enter starts the run, ↑ takes you back to the list of scopes, Esc cancels. The request is passed to the demo agent verbatim, so the more concrete it is, the tighter the demo. Such a request is treated as self‑contained — Junie won't go hunting through git history to find unrelated context.

### Demoing a specific feature from scratch

When you want a demo of an existing feature (not a recent change), name the feature explicitly in the same text field:

```
the file-tree drag-and-drop in the sidebar
```

Junie will resolve how to reach it (menu item, hotkey, URL, etc.) and walk through it.

## What happens when you run `/demo`

A `/demo` run goes through four phases. Knowing the phases helps you interpret what's on screen at any moment.

### 1\. Plan

Before any VM starts, Junie writes a short visible demo plan — an ordered list of user‑visible milestones, e.g.:

```
1. Launch the app — main window shows the file tree.
2. Open Settings via the gear icon — Settings dialog appears.
3. Toggle "Dark theme" — UI re-renders in dark colors.
4. Close Settings — main window remains in dark mode.
```

When the run is scoped to a diff — one of the git scopes of the picker, or a review-style request — Junie reads that diff before planning and turns every user-visible change in it into a milestone, so the plan covers the whole change set.

The plan is your contract with the agent. If a step looks wrong, interrupt with Esc and adjust the request before the VM starts.

### 2\. Build and launch

Junie:

1.  (Optionally) builds artifacts on your host machine — but only if `.junie/demo.md` explicitly asks for it. By default nothing is built on the host.

2.  Starts the VM (`vm_start`). Your project root is mounted at `/workspace` inside it.

3.  Builds the project inside the VM (commands come from `.junie/demo.md` if present, otherwise Junie figures them out).

4.  Launches the app in the background and waits for it to be ready (health endpoint, log line, or just a visual wait).

A blank screen right after `vm_start` is normal — the app hasn't started yet.

### 3\. Demonstrate

Junie drives the running app via Computer Use: clicks, keystrokes, screenshots. The TUI shows a `Working… esc to stop` indicator while the agent is acting. Each action is followed by an automatic screenshot, so you'll see the run progress step by step.

If a visual attempt fails 2–3 times and Junie can't figure out the next step from the screen, it falls back to targeted code lookups (grep + open file). This is allowed but rare — the primary source of truth is the running app, not the source code.

### 4\. Finish

Junie CLI shuts down the VM (`vm_stop`) and writes a structured Markdown report with two main sections:

-   What has been tested: the steps that ran and what was visible.

-   Result: pass / fail / partial, plus any issues spotted.

The screenshots, video, and HTML report from the run are saved alongside the session — see [Output artifacts](/docs/junie-cli-demo.html#output-artifacts) for the exact paths.

## Stopping a demo

-   Press Esc while the `Working…` indicator is visible to interrupt the agent. The VM is shut down cleanly.

-   The agent won't launch the VM twice in one session unless you explicitly ask.

## Output artifacts

After a `/demo` run finishes, you get a folder of artifacts on disk that you can share, attach to a PR, or rewatch later. They live under your Junie home directory, grouped by session:

```
~/.junie/sessions/<session-id>/demo/
├── screenshots/         PNG screenshots captured during the run
│   └── shot_20260520_120005_000.png …
├── demo.mp4             screen recording of the VM (if recording finished)
├── captions.vtt         caption track aligned to the video
└── report.html          self-contained HTML report
```

What each one contains:

-   `report.html`: the main artifact. A single self-contained page with the user request, the agent's Markdown answer ('What has been tested' + result), the embedded video, and the screenshots inline. This is what you usually attach to a PR or send to a teammate.

-   `demo.mp4`: the screen recording. Only present if the recorder started and was stopped cleanly before VM teardown. Embedded inside `report.html` too.

-   `captions.vtt`: WebVTT caption track generated from screenshot timestamps. Used by `report.html` to label moments in the video.

-   `screenshots/`: every screenshot Computer Use took during the run, one PNG per `computer` call.

The Markdown answer the agent shows in the TUI is not written to a separate file — it lives in the session transcript and inside `report.html`. If you want the raw text, copy it from the TUI or open the report.

Persistence: artifacts are kept across sessions — nothing is auto-cleaned. If you want them gone, delete the session folder under `~/.junie/sessions/` manually.

## Customizing the demo

`.junie/demo.md` tells the demo agent project‑specific build and launch commands. Use it when 'how to start the app' isn't obvious from the source tree. The [Quick start](/docs/junie-cli-demo.html#quick-start) above shows the basic structure; this section lists the kinds of things you can usefully put inside.

Common things to put in `.junie/demo.md`:

-   `vm: <name>` — required. The agent passes this value to `vm_start` as the template name, and the action fails if it's missing. The name must resolve to a Dockerfile under `.junie/vms/`: either a subdirectory (`.junie/vms/<name>/Dockerfile`) or the literal value `default` for the top-level `.junie/vms/Dockerfile`.

-   The exact build command(s) to run inside the VM.

-   The launch command — always background it (`&` or `nohup … &`).

-   A health check Junie can wait on before interacting with the UI, e.g. `# ready when http://localhost:3000 responds 200`.

-   A preflight check for services you run on the host yourself — inside the VM your host machine is reachable as `host.docker.internal`, so a line like `curl -sf http://host.docker.internal:9400/health` lets the demo fail fast when the backend isn't up.

-   Test users the agent may log in with, and known quirks it should avoid. Never put secret values in `demo.md` — the file is committed; pass secrets to the VM through the template's `mounts` file instead.

-   Whether the jar/binary should be built on the host first (and the exact `bash` command to do it — Junie will only run it if you explicitly ask).

## First-run setup

Before every run, `/demo` checks that your project has both halves of a working configuration:

-   a VM template — some `.junie/vms/<name>/Dockerfile`, and

-   a launch command in `.junie/demo.md`.

If either is missing, the run won't start a real demo. Instead, Junie creates whatever isn't there yet and asks how you want to proceed. This is not a one-shot: a `demo.md` that was seeded and never touched counts as no setup at all, so the prompt keeps coming back until you edit the file. Junie never rewrites a file that already exists.

Up to two files appear in your project:

### What gets seeded

-   `.junie/demo.md` — the project-level guide that tells the demo agent which VM to use and how to launch your app. The file is free-form Markdown; the agent reads it as instructions before doing anything. Two things in it are essential:

    -   `vm:`: the name of a subdirectory under `.junie/vms/`. The seeded file already has `vm: template-vm` wired up.

    -   The launch command: how to start your app inside the VM. Goes under the `## Running inside the VM` section.

    Everything else is optional. Useful things to grow `demo.md` with later include: host-side build steps you want Junie to run, environment variables, test users, known quirks, or links to other docs.

-   `.junie/vms/template-vm/Dockerfile` — the VM image. Extends `registry.jetbrains.team/p/junie-cli/containers/demo-base:2` — see [Prerequisites](/docs/junie-cli-demo.html#prerequisites) for what the base ships. Add the apt packages and language runtimes your app needs on top.

### Filling it in

Right after seeding, Junie shows you the two files and offers a choice (navigate with the arrow keys, `enter` to pick):

-   Yes, fill them in for me — Junie inspects your project (package manager, dev/start command, port, runtime version requirements, backing services, login walls, required tokens), asks you to confirm the resulting plan, and only then fills in `demo.md` and the `Dockerfile` — plus a `mounts` line when a host-side credential has to reach the VM. Review what it wrote, then re-run `/demo`.

-   No, I'll do it myself — Junie leaves the seeded files untouched so you can edit them by hand.

You can also trigger the automatic fill-in later — ask Junie to "set up `/demo` ", or invoke the `demo-setup` skill with `$demo-setup`. Either way Junie edits only `demo.md`, the VM `Dockerfile`, and — when a host credential must reach the VM — the template's `mounts` file, and leaves the final review and the real demo run to you.

### After editing

Once both files are filled in, re-run `/demo`. Junie will pick up the VM template and start a real demo run. From then on your configuration is treated as authoritative and Junie leaves it alone — the check is simply whether `demo.md` still looks exactly like the file that was seeded. Edit it in any way and it is yours; Junie stops asking and never second-guesses what you wrote.

To go through the setup again, either ask Junie to "set up `/demo` ", or clear the configuration and re-run `/demo`: emptying `.junie/demo.md` brings back the prompt while keeping your VM template, and deleting both `.junie/vms/` and `.junie/demo.md` reseeds them from scratch.

> ### tip
>
> Note: the seeded `demo.md` carries explanatory HTML comments at the top describing what each section is for. Once your file is in good shape, delete those comments so the agent context isn't bloated by generator boilerplate it doesn't need.

If you'd rather author `.junie/demo.md` and the Dockerfile from scratch without using the seeded starter, just create them yourself before the first `/demo` run — the seed only fires when nothing is there.

## Multiple VM templates in one project

`.junie/vms/` is a directory — you can put as many VM subdirectories under it as you want, each with its own Dockerfile (and optionally its own `mounts` file). A typical layout for a project that ships several VMs side by side:

```
.junie/
├── demo.md
└── vms/
    ├── backend-vm/
    │   ├── Dockerfile
    │   └── mounts
    ├── frontend-vm/
    │   └── Dockerfile
    └── cli-vm/
        └── Dockerfile
```

All templates discovered under `.junie/vms/` are listed to the demo agent on every `/demo` run, so it can pick the right one according to the instructions in `.junie/demo.md`.

## Examples

### Verify a fix you just made

```
> fix the bug where the search box loses focus after typing one character
…Junie edits files, runs tests…
> /demo
…pick "Changes from this session" (or "Uncommitted changes")
```

Junie picks up the change, opens the search box, types several characters, and shows that focus stays.

### Demo a feature in a fresh repo

```
> /demo
…press ↓ past the last scope to reach the text field
> open the project, run the example notebook, show the chart it produces
```

Useful for onboarding videos or PR descriptions.

### Compare a 'before / after' change

```
> /demo
…press ↓ past the last scope to reach the text field
> show the old behavior, then the new behavior of the export button
```

If the session history doesn't contain a clear "before" state, Junie will note that in the report instead of inventing one.

## Troubleshooting

'Demo agent requires access to a model with computer use support…'

Your active model isn't on the supported list. Today that list is GPT‑5.4, GPT‑5.5, and GPT‑5.6 SOL; more models will land later. Switch via [Junie CLI Model selection](junie-cli-model-selection.html).

The VM starts but the screen stays blank

Normal in the first few seconds after `vm_start`. If it persists, the app probably failed to launch — check `.junie/demo.md` for the right build/launch commands, or add a health check Junie can wait on.

Junie keeps reading source files instead of clicking

This usually means the entry path (how to reach the feature) isn't obvious. Describe the entry path yourself in the request field, for example `open Settings via Cmd+, and toggle X`.

`/demo` is disabled / greyed out

Either Docker isn't running, or no Computer Use model is available for your account.
